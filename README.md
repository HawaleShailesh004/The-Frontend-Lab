# ðŸ§ª The Frontend Lab

Welcome to **The Frontend Lab** â€” a growing set of mini-projects built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

Each project in this lab explores a specific concept, feature, or UI behavior in frontend development. The goal is to build small, focused apps while mastering core technologies and best practices.
